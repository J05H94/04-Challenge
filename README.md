In this project, we created a small quiz. We have sixty seconds to answer five questions. Every incorrect answer takes ten seconds away from the timer. Once you finish all five questions or the timer runs out, the quiz ends and the time leftover if any is your score. Once you make it to the end you can add your initals to the score board, which is saved to local storage.
